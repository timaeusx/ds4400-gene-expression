# Classifying Acute Forms of Leukemia using Gene Expression Data

# Abstract: In several sentences, summarize your project (e.g., think of a Tweet).

# Documentation:

# Introduction: Summarize your project report in several paragraphs.
## What is the problem? For example, what are you trying to solve? Describe the motivation.
## Why is this problem interesting? Is this problem helping us solve a bigger task in some way? Where would we find use cases for this problem?
## What is the approach you propose to tackle the problem? What approaches make sense for this problem? Would they work well or not? Feel free to speculate here based on what we taught in class.
## Why is the approach a good approach compared with other competing methods? For example, did you find any reference for solving this problem previously? If there are, how does your approach differ from theirs?
## What are the key components of my approach and results? Also, include any specific limitations.

# Setup: Set up the stage for your experimental results.
## Describe the dataset, including its basic statistics.
## Describe the experimental setup, including what models you are going to run, what parameters you plan to use, and what computing environment you will execute on.
## Describe the problem setup (e.g., for neural networks, describe the network structure that you are going to use in the experiments).

# Results: Describe the results from your experiments.
## Main results: Describe the main experimental results you have; this is where you highlight the most interesting findings.
## Supplementary results: Describe the parameter choices you have made while running the experiments. This part goes into justifying those choices.

# Discussion: Discuss the results obtained above. If your results are very good, see if you could compare them with some existing approaches that you could find online. If your results are not as good as you had hoped for, make a good-faith diagnosis about what the problem is.

# Conclusion: In several sentences, summarize what you have done in this project.

# References: Put any links, papers, blog posts, or GitHub repositories that you have borrowed from/found useful here
